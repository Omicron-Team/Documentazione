\subsubsection{Configuration of the Back-end}
By following the next steps you will correctly configure your back-end:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{NOTE}: serverless may have asked you to insert your credentials after his installation in the section "Installing the Back-end module"(1st step of the list). If you already login at that point you can skip this step.\\ 
In order to configure serverless you need to run the command:
\begin{center}
serverless config credentials -o --provider aws --key \$key --secret \$secret
\end{center}
where \$key is your AWS Access Key Id and \$secret is your AWS Secret Access Key.
\end{enumerate}
