\subsubsection{Services}
The \textbf{Services} layer contains functions used to create an inteface for external services, like AWS\textsubscript{G} and Stripe\textsubscript{G}.\\
In the following class diagram we show every typescript\textsubscript{G} module used. We will represent every module as a class, since it contains public functions and it's used as a cached singleton, thanks to the typescript definition.
