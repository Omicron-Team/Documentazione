\subsubsection{Data prefetching}
The data prefetching on \textit{EmporioLambda} makes use of Next.js pre-rendering.\\
More precisely, Next.js allows the use of 2 types of pre-rendering:
\begin{itemize}
\item static generation: the system generates the HTML at build time. The pre-rendered HTML is then reused on each request;

\end{figure}
\vspace{0.7cm}
\item server-side rendering: the system generates the HTML on each request.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.70]{res/Architettura/Frontend/img/serverSideRendering}\\
\caption{Server-side generation scheme}
\end{figure}
\vspace{0.7cm}
\end{itemize}
One difference between these 2 pre-rendering methods is the response time of the website.
Static generation is faster than server-side rendering so the second one should only be used when necessary. Each page can use a different type of prefetch.\\
In \textit{EmporioLambda} each page prefetches data using these 2 methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item getStaticProps: a function that returns a GetStaticProps object, which indicates that the page will use static generation.
\item getServerSideProps: a function that return a GetServerSideProps object, which indicates that the page will use server-side rendering. It will thus render again after receiving new data.
\end{itemize}
Both functions return a Typescript object called props which contains the needed data. This object will be passed to the component part of the Front-end module.\\
More information about Next.js pre-rendering can be found on this page: \url{https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/data-fetching/two-forms}.\\
All of the pages in \textit{EmporioLambda} use server-side rendering.
