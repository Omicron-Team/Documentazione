\subsection{Testing}
In this section is shown how to run the testing process to check your code work and its syntax.\\ 
To test the EmporioLambda code the following tools will be used:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Cypress}: for unit testing;
\item \textbf{ESLint} and \textbf{Prettier} for the syntax check of the code.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Unit testing}
To run every unit test you can use this command on your CLI:
\begin{center}
npm run test
\end{center}
In case you want to test a single function in the Back-End module you can run the previous command and add a the name of the function as parameter.\\
Example:
\begin{center}
npm run test -f \$functionName
\end{center}
For the Back-End module you can also check the code coverage by running the command:
\begin{center}
npm run coverage
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Static code analysis}
Informations on the rules used to run the static code analysis can be found in the files:
\begin{itemize}
\item .eslintrc.js
\item .prettierrc.js
\end{itemize}
The static code analysis can be done by running the following commands in your CLI:
\begin{center}
npm run lint
\end{center}
this will check the code style with lint and prettier and try to fix the errors where it is possible.\\ 
If you just want to check the code without automatic error fix you can run this command:
\begin{center}
npm run checkWithLint
\end{center}
